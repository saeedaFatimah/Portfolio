## Projects

### [Employee Churn Prediction](projects/employee-churn-prediction)
- **Description:** A project aimed at predicting employee churn using machine learning techniques to identify employees likely to leave the company.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical features.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized feature distributions and relationships, performed correlation analysis.
  - Feature Engineering: Created new features and selected important ones for the model.
  - Model Training: Implemented various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, and performed hyperparameter tuning.
  - Model Evaluation: Assessed models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, and used cross-validation to ensure consistency.
- **Skills Used:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, data visualization.

### [Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis](projects/customer-segmentation-rfm)
- **Description:** A project for segmenting customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics to improve marketing strategies.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared customer transaction data.
  - RFM Analysis: Calculated RFM scores for each customer and segmented them into different groups.
  - Visualization: Created visualizations to illustrate customer segments and their characteristics.
  - Clustering: Applied K-means clustering to group customers based on RFM scores.
- **Skills Used:** Python, pandas, clustering algorithms, data visualization.
