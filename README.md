# Saeeda Fatimah's Data Science Portfolio

I am a certified Data Scientist with a robust background in Software Quality Assurance (SQA) and a strong passion for data science. With a BS in Software Engineering from the Virtual University of Pakistan and a Professional Data Analyst Certification from Karachi.AI, I have developed a comprehensive skill set in both quality assurance and data analysis.

During my time as an SQA Engineer, I collaborated with development teams to ensure product quality and reliability. I gained extensive experience in writing test cases, bug tracking, and reporting across multiple platforms, including mobile and web applications. My responsibilities included testing applications across different devices, maintaining test data for accurate results, and managing QA for various projects.

However, my passion for uncovering insights from data and my attraction to the rapidly evolving field of data science led me to pursue further education and certification in this area. Through my intensive certification program, I gained expertise in predictive modeling, statistical analysis, machine learning, data cleaning, preprocessing, time series analysis, recommendation systems, and hypothesis testing. I am proficient in Python and SQL, and I excel at using data visualization tools like Power BI to communicate insights effectively.

I am now eager to leverage my analytical aptitude and data science skills to make meaningful contributions to a dynamic data science team. I am passionate about continuously learning and staying updated with the latest advancements in data science and machine learning.
